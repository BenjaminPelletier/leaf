# Welcome to Leaf

Leaf is designed as an open source vario for paragliding.  The vision: a device small enough to mount anywhere (riser, harness strap), but capable of even the most advanced features... and of course, an extremely affordable price tag compared to alternatives.

However, because Leaf is a small, portable, battery-powered, and packed full of sensors and computational power, it also can be a great development platform for other uses besides paragliding.  The PCB was designed with flexibility and expansion in mind.
